# ConsoleChess

This is a project where my aim is to create a console based C++ online Chess game.

_Scale_

Idea is that the online games will be runned from a database. each game will be refreshed every few seconds to detect turn changes etc.
One user can play multiple games at once and each match can have different type of settings such as turn timer and etc.

_Interface_

Interface is going to be created using some type of an console manipulation library that can be found for C++. Current canditate is PDCurses unless i wont find anything else.

_Steps_

First step is creating the game as barebones as possible and work up from that gradually increasing features.
